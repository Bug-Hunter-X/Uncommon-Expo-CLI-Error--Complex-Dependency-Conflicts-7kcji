This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a complex dependency tree or conflicting package versions.  The error message itself can be quite generic, such as `Error: Command failed: ...` or a more specific error related to a particular package.  The root cause often lies in the interaction between different packages and their dependencies, particularly those related to React Native and its ecosystem.  Debugging usually involves carefully examining the `package.json` file and the `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` file to pinpoint conflicting dependencies.
