# Uncommon Expo CLI Error: Complex Dependency Conflicts

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when using the Expo CLI. The error is not a typical, easily identifiable issue but stems from complex interactions within the project's dependency tree.  The challenge lies in identifying the conflicting dependencies and resolving them without breaking other parts of the project.

## Problem

The project's `package.json` and lock files contain conflicting package versions or dependencies that the Expo CLI cannot resolve during the build or run process.  This leads to cryptic error messages that don't clearly pinpoint the cause.

## Solution

The solution focuses on meticulously examining the project's dependencies and resolving conflicts.  This includes:

1. **Analyzing `package.json`**: Identify potential conflicts between package versions and dependencies.
2. **Inspecting `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`**: Examine the precise versions of packages and their dependencies to locate inconsistencies.
3. **Version Resolution**:  Try upgrading or downgrading conflicting packages to compatible versions.  Often a specific version combination can trigger the error.
4. **Dependency Tree Visualization**: Use tools to visualize the project's dependency tree to better understand the relationships between packages and identify potential conflicts.
5. **Selective Package Removal (if needed)**: Temporarily remove packages to isolate if they're contributing to the issue.
6. **Clean and Reinstall**: Sometimes simply cleaning the project's cache and reinstalling dependencies can fix seemingly elusive issues.

This repository provides example code to illustrate the problem and a solution.
