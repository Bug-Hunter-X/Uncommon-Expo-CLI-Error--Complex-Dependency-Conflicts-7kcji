This solution focuses on systematically investigating and resolving dependencies.  First, carefully examine the `package.json` and lock file to identify version mismatches or conflicting packages.   Then, use the process of elimination: try updating one package at a time, carefully watching to see if the issue is resolved. If upgrading does not fix the problem, consider downgrading individual packages. If the problem persists, you may have to resort to removing packages temporarily to isolate if they are the cause of the issue. Cleaning the project's cache with `expo prebuild --clean` and reinstalling dependencies (`expo install`) can sometimes be helpful.  If the issues persist you may need to create a minimal reproducible example, removing other unnecessary code.  Consider posting the specifics in a GitHub issue or on a forum for community support.
